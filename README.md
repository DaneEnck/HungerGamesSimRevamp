# Hunger Games Simulator Revamp

## Purpose

This project will simulate a Hunger Games style battle royale with participants of the user's choice. The simulator will generate text describing what the participants do, and keep track of information such as who has died, what items participants acquire, and what alliances have been made.

This project is directly inspired by and meant to improve upon [BrantSteele's Hunger Games Simulator](https://brantsteele.net/hungergames)

## How to use

Currently, there is no active server hosting this project. This will change when more planned features are added.

To run a local development server, first insall [node.js](https://nodejs.org) if you do not already have it.
Run "npm install" to download dependencies, then run "npm run dev" to launch the local server.
Development server is then accessed at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
