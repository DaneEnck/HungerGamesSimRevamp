# Hunger Games Simulator Revamp

## Purpose

This project will simulate a Hunger Games style battle royale with participants of the user's choice. The simulator will generate text describing what the participants do, and keep track of information such as who has died, what items participants acquire, and what alliances have been made.

This project is directly inspired by and meant to improve upon [BrantSteele's Hunger Games Simulator](https://brantsteele.net/hungergames)

## How to use

Currently, there is no active server hosting this project. This will change when more planned features are added.

To run a local development server, first insall [node.js](https://nodejs.org) if you do not already have it.
Run "npm install" to download dependencies, then run "npm run dev" to launch the local server.
Development server is then accessed at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).



A note regarding the irregular commit history prior to November 14 2023:
I've been pushing changes via the Github extension on Visual Studio code. I have discovered that using this extension, when pushing multiple commits at the same time, it will automatically have the same message as the most recent commit, leaving out details of the other commits in the push. I will attempt to avoid this in the future, either by giving each commit its own push or finding a way to properly title my pushes using the extension.
